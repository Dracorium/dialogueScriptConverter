KUNAL: Please help me out. I’ve already talked to so many people and they all say you know where those spirits are.
#LOITERING SPIRIT: (eyes slide to the side of his face in a slightly unnerving manner, but trust me that’s just his thinking face)
KUNAL: They’re starting their migration soon and I know they have to be somewhere nearby, I just don’t know where.
#KUNAL: (There is a small pause)(moves in closer and whispers)
KUNAL: Tell me your secrets oh stoic one.
#LOITERING SPIRIT:(Still isn’t talking. But we don’t want him just sitting;; Maybe like swinging his legs or like looking away slowly, something to show that he is disinterested.)
KUNAL: Seriously? You’re not even listening. Why can’t I- oh, nevermind this is never going to work.
#KUNAL: (leaves to go inside the store)
#CHARLIE: (Charlie goes into the store and waves hello to the loitering spirit as they pass.)
#LOITERING SPIRIT: (small waves back to Charlie. This is the clue that you can’t verbally communicate)
